### üå± **Stage 1: Foundation ‚Äì Get Comfortable with Go**

**Objective:** Get a solid understanding of Go‚Äôs syntax and core concepts, as Go's syntax is very different from Python/Java.

#### Key Concepts to Learn:
- Variables, types, and basic syntax
- Functions and methods
- Structs and interfaces
- Go‚Äôs **zero-value system** (very important for DSA)
- Slices (like dynamic arrays in Go)
- Goroutines and channels (important for concurrency later)

#### Resources:
- Go Documentation: [https://golang.org/doc/](https://golang.org/doc/)
- **Go by Example**: [https://gobyexample.com/](https://gobyexample.com/)
  
#### Mini Project Idea:
- Build a **CLI calculator** or a **to-do list app** to practice Go basics.

### üìö **Stage 2: Core Data Structures in Go**

**Objective:** Learn to **implement** common data structures in Go, which is important because Go doesn‚Äôt have built-in collections like Java‚Äôs `ArrayList` or C++‚Äôs `std::vector`.

#### Key Data Structures to Learn (and Implement):
1. **Arrays & Slices**: Learn how Go handles arrays and dynamic arrays (slices).
2. **Linked List**: Learn both singly and doubly linked lists (manually implemented).
3. **Stack & Queue**: Implement using slices and understand use cases like recursion and scheduling.
4. **HashMap (Map in Go)**: Practice implementing hashing and collision resolution (e.g., linear probing or chaining).
5. **Binary Tree (BST)**: Learn binary search trees, traversals (pre-order, in-order, post-order).
6. **Heap**: Build a binary heap (min-heap or max-heap).
7. **Graphs**: Represent graphs with adjacency lists and matrices.

#### Resources:
- **Go Wiki**: [Go Wiki on Data Structures](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki)
- **GeeksforGeeks**: [Go DSA tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures-in-golang/)

#### Practice:
- Implement each of these data structures **from scratch**.
- Solve basic problems on **Leetcode**, **HackerRank**, or **Codewars** in Go.

#### Mini Project Idea:
- Create a **text-based task manager** that uses a **stack for undo/redo** functionality and a **queue for task scheduling**.

### ‚ö° **Stage 3: Algorithms and Problem Solving**

**Objective:** Now that you have your data structures down, it‚Äôs time to tackle **algorithms**. You'll need to implement algorithms in Go and solve problems to **hone your coding speed** and **problem-solving skills**.

#### Key Algorithms to Learn:
1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort
2. **Search Algorithms**: Linear search, binary search
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Basic problems like Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem
4. **Greedy Algorithms**: Activity selection, coin change problem
5. **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm
6. **Backtracking**: N-Queens problem, Sudoku solver
7. **Divide and Conquer**: Binary search, merge sort

#### Resources:
- **Leetcode**: Start solving problems with the **"easy" difficulty**, and gradually work up to harder problems.
- **GeeksforGeeks**: Go-specific algorithms tutorial
- **The Go Programming Language**: Book by Alan A. A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan (great resource for algorithms and Go-specific coding)

#### Practice:
- Solve 3-5 problems per day on Leetcode (start with easy, then medium).
- Focus on **understanding the time and space complexities** of each algorithm.

#### Mini Project Idea:
- **Web scraper**: Use Go to scrape a website for specific data, storing it in a data structure of your choice (linked list, queue, map).
- **Simple chatbot**: Implement a basic chatbot that uses a tree (or graph) to manage dialogue paths.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Stage 4: Go & DevOps Projects**

**Objective:** Now that you‚Äôre comfortable with DSA, let‚Äôs apply what you‚Äôve learned to real-world DevOps/SRE tasks, where Go really shines.

#### Project Ideas (Using DSA Knowledge in Go):
1. **Build Your Own CLI Tools**:
   - A command-line to-do list that uses a **queue** for scheduling tasks.
   - A **log parser** tool that stores data in **hash maps** or **trees** for filtering logs efficiently.

2. **Implement a Custom Web Server**:
   - Build a **simple HTTP server** in Go (for learning concurrency with goroutines and channels).
   - Use **binary trees or hashmaps** to handle requests efficiently.

3. **Monitoring Tool**:
   - Create a **basic monitoring tool** that tracks server health, stores data in a **hashmap**, and visualizes trends over time.
   - Implement **graph algorithms** (like BFS/DFS) to traverse the system and check interdependent services.

4. **Kubernetes Controller** (Advanced):
   - If you‚Äôre familiar with Kubernetes, you can build a basic controller that schedules jobs based on a **priority queue** or **heap**.
   - This requires knowledge of Kubernetes API and Go client libraries.

5. **Distributed Systems Simulation**:
   - Build a **distributed system** (e.g., a simple key-value store) using **graphs or trees** to represent network nodes.
   - Implement **fault-tolerance mechanisms** and use Go‚Äôs concurrency to simulate nodes interacting.

### üî• **Stage 5: Advanced Go Concepts & Deepening Your SRE Skills**

**Objective:** Once you‚Äôve mastered the basics, it‚Äôs time to go deeper into Go‚Äôs advanced features and concepts.

#### Key Concepts to Learn:
1. **Concurrency in Go**: Master **goroutines** and **channels** for high-concurrency systems.
2. **Go Routines for Parallelism**: Learn when and how to use **goroutines** for performance optimization (multi-threading, parallel tasks).
3. **Memory Management in Go**: Understand how Go handles memory allocation and garbage collection.
4. **Cloud-Native Tools**: Dive into how **Go is used** to build cloud-native tools (like Kubernetes controllers, Helm charts, etc.).
5. **Networking in Go**: Learn how to work with **TCP/UDP** sockets, HTTP requests, and APIs.

#### Resources:
- **The Go Programming Language** (book)
- **Go Wiki**: [Concurrency Patterns](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki)
- **Go by Example** (Concurrency section)

#### Mini Project Idea:
- **Distributed Key-Value Store** using **Go concurrency** to simulate multiple nodes interacting with each other (eventually consistent).
